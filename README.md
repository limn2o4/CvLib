# CvLib
A plug-in face detect  project, still a idea
## The Project:
this t is a project for graduation and imporve my engineering ablities in Machine learning.

The project contains a compeletely pipeline for face recognize,face landmark and face matching.

It will take long time to accomplish this target. now I just collecting data and paper for support.

target 1: using SSD neteork to build a feedback system of face recognize,and make progesss in 

target 2: using Dlib to finish face landmark

target 3: using K_means or DT algorithm to clustering


## About License
I don't care about somebody will copy or sell my work if it's has been done.I code this for everyone
